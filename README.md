# Cowrie-Honeypot
School lab on understanding TTP's and to observe the behavior of an actual attacker in a honeypot. This lab made use of 2 VM's — an Ubuntu Server 20.04 VM and and a second VM for testing.

Abstract: This honeypot demonstration provides an emulation that records the session of an actual attacker. With this session recording, a Hunt Analyst will gain a hands-on understanding of the attackers’ tools, tactics and procedures (TTPs). A term that is increasingly being used in Cyber Defense and Incident Response.
